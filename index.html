    <h1>ChatMusic User Manual</h1>
    <h1>Installation Instructions</h1>
    <ul>Install Max MSP from cycling74.com</ul>
    <ul>The current version of the patch was created on Max 8.2 running on MacOS Ventura (13.0)</ul>
    <ul>The patch will most likely work on other systems</ul>
    <ul>You can run Max patches forever with a trial version of Max, but you cannot save changes. The patch is set up so that changes can be saved to external text files, so the patch should work properly with the free version of Max.</ul>
    <ul>Make a folder in your computer called "ChatMusic".</ul><ul>Open Max and navigate to Options > File Preferences</ul><ul>Click the "+" option in the bottom left corner of the File Preferences window to add a path to the file paths of your Max installation.</ul>
    <ul>Clcik the "choose" button that appears.</ul>
    <ul>In the menu that appears, navigate to the ChatMusic folder you already created, and press Open.</ul>
    <ul>Ensure that the "include subfolders" box is checked.</ul>
    <ul>Now close Max 8.</ul>
    <ul>Copy the latest version of ChatMusic (which should have a name like ChatMusic_0.2), and the latest version of the externals folder, into the ChatMusic folder.</ul>
    <ul>If there is an existing version of ChatMusic, you should move it out of the ChatMusic folder if you wish to keep a copy.</ul><ul>Launch the program by opening "ChatMusic.maxpat" inside the latest version folder. Ensure it opens in Max 8, and not any other version of Max (or a standalone software made in Max which may already be installed on your computer, by rightclicking the file and clicking "Open with", then choosing Max 8)</ul>
    <h1>Setting up the patch</h1>
    <ul>You should always start by pressing the init button</ul>
    <ul>if something goes wrong and you need to reset settings, you should first try pressing "lb" and then if that doesn't fix things, try "init" again. If this doesn't work, ensure any custom settings are saved, close the patch, re-open, and make sure to press "init"</ul>




    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <details>
        <summary>How does the color coding of patch cords work?</summary><p>The patch cords are colored to give an indication of the type of information that is carried in them, which can speed up debugging or understanding the logic of the patch.
        </p>
        <p>The cords are coded as follows:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>black</td>
                <td>sends a bang to execute collected data</td></tr>
        <tr>
                <td>red</td>
                <td>pitch information</td></tr>
        <tr>
                <td>magenta/pink</td>
                <td>rhythmic information</td></tr>
                <td>cyan/green-blue</td>
                <td>ASCII code</td></tr>
                <td>grey</td>
                <td>extras attached to notes such as articulation, lyrics</td></tr>
                <td>blue</td>
                <td>messages that clear/empty/reset objects (e.g. zlclear, set, clear)</td></tr>

        <summary>How do I add videos?</summary>
        <ol>
            <li>In advance, prepare a folder of your video files. I recommend making them all the same file format and editing the filenames of the movies so they are short and easy to remember and type.</li>
            <li>On the main window, click "; videoplayer open"</li>
            <li>IN the videobank_player window that opens, click the type of file you wish to load frin the file type dropdown meny(e.g. MPEG = MP4) </li>
            <li>drag and drop the folder containing your video files onto the area marked "drop a folder of video files here!</li>
            <li>Play videos by typing VIDEO at the start of a chat command</li>
        </ol>
